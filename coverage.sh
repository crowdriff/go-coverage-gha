# This is a simple script to generate an HTML coverage report,
# and SVG badge for your Go project.
#
# Place it some where in your code tree and execute it.
# If your tests pass, next to the script you'll find
# the coverage.html report and coverage.svg badge.
#
# You can add the badge to your README.md as such:
#  [![Go Coverage](PATH_TO/coverage.svg)](https://raw.githack.com/URL/coverage.html)
#
# Visit https://raw.githack.com/ to find the correct URL.
